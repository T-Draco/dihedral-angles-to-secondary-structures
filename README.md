# dihedral_angles_to_secondary_structures
Protein PDB files possess the atomic coordinates of amino acid atom locations. These atomic coordinates can be parsed into dihedral angle values, which can then be used to predict the secondary structures of proteins. To find the modules for converting PDB atomic coordinates into dihedral angle values usable for this code, find my "dihedral_angle_radians_to_degrees" repository at: https://github.com/sstonya/dihedral_angle_radians_to_degrees.git

This program utilizes Python, which is a free use program with an open source license. This repository is intended for the conversion of dihedral angle values into secondary structure predictions. NOTE: these predictions can vary based on what values you input for your phi and psi angles. This module was made for non-profit reasons. Improvement edits to this repository are highly encouraged with proper source code citations and use of the GitHub branch function.
